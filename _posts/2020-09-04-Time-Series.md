<p> When we analyze time series statistically, an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) can be used for the better understanding of the data. </p>
<p> ARIMA model is also widely utilized to predict future values of the series by training forecast model. Today, we are going to understand and utilize the concept of ARIMA model in order to find out the mean velocity of individual public bikes across one month time period.</p>

## Preprocessing <!--more-->
* TOC
{:toc}

Through the preprocessing stage, we process messy original data to the perfect data we can analyze with proper models.

{% highlight ruby %}
{% raw %}
{% bike = pd.read_csv('공공자전거 대여이력 정보_2020.01_056.csv', sep = ',')" %}
{% print(bike.shape) -> (1048575, 11) %}
{% print(bike.isnull().sum()) %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

![model.head]({{ "/assets/img/2020-09-24-ARIMA-model-head(5).PNG" | relative_url }})

First, calculate the average velocity by dividing distance with used time. Next, the information at the first row is not that friendly. simplify it by removing the str value of bike's number. Finally, after converting time feature to a time series and indexification, we can conclude preprocessing step and move over to the analysis process.

{% highlight ruby %}
{% raw %}
{% bike['Average Velocity (meters/minutes)'] = bike['이용거리'] / bike['이용시간'] %}
{% bike['bikenum'] = bike['자전거번호'].apply(lambda x: x[-5:]) %}
{% bike['date'] = pd.to_datetime(bike['대여일시']) %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


## Time-series analysis
<p> When given a time series data X with an real number index, ARIMA models can be denoted to ARIMA(p,q,r) where p is the order of the autoregressive model and AR(p) is the extent to which the previous value affects the subsequent values. r is the order of the moving average model and Ma(r) is a trend in which the mean value of Random variables increases or decreases continuously. q is the degree of differencing. </p>

<p> Consider the public bike model follows ARIMA(2,1,2) model. Train the data and evaluate the result both visually using graph and mathematically using the rmse value. </p>

$$ Yt = α1Yt-1 + α2Yt-2 + β1εt-1 + β2εt-2 + εt $$ 

{% highlight ruby %}
{% raw %}
{% print("%d num bike's average velocity is %.2f (m/m)" %(int(bike_number), bike_train_speed)) %}
{% 14251 num bike's average velocity is 181.14 (m/m) %}
{% print("%d num bike's average velocity is %.2f (m/m)." %(int(bike_number), bike_test_speed)) %}
{% 14251 num bike's average velocity is 159.87 (m/m) %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## Time-series prediction
ARIMA model can predict future events by using a generalization of the method of autoregressive forecasting. Calculate the predicted data of the model using the train data, and evaluate it with test datas seperated beforehand. So at last, the ARIMA model is trained to calculate the average speed of bike regardless of time period, and by inserting the time series data into variables, the velocity value beyond the time period of the data can be obtained.

{% highlight ruby %}
{% raw %}
{% model = ARIMA(bike_train['Average Velocity (meters/minutes)'].values, order=(2,1,2)) %}
{% model_fit = model.fit(trend='c', full_output=True, disp=True) %}
{% fig = model_fit.plot_predict() %}
{% residuals = pd.DataFrame(model_fit.resid) %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

![model.result]({{ "/assets/img/2020-09-24-ARIMA-model-result.PNG" | relative_url }})

![model.graph]({{ "/assets/img/arima2.png" | relative_url }})

The graph below visually compares the minimum, maximum, and average expected velocity values calculated by the model with the test data. Finally, measure the accuracy of the model by calculating the value of the mean square root deviation that covers the difference between the estimated value with the value that the model predicted.

{% highlight ruby %}
{% raw %}
{% fore = model_fit.forecast(steps=20) %}
{% rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(pred_y, test_y)) %}
{% print("model's rmse is %.2f." %(rmse)) %}
{% model's rmse is 55.91. %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
